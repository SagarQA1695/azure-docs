# Azure Active Directory Identity Protection - Security overview

The Security overview gives insight into your organization’s security posture. It helps identify potential attacks and understand the effectiveness of your policies.

The ‘Security overview’ is broadly divided into two sections:

- Trend graphs, provide a timeline of risk in your organization.
- Tiles, highlight the key ongoing issues in your organization and suggest how to quickly take action.

You can find the security overview page in the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) > **Protection** > **Identity Protection** > **Overview**.

The security overview page is being replaced by the [Microsoft Entra ID Protection dashboard](id-protection-dashboard.md)
