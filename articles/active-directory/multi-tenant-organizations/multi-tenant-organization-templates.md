Administrators staying in control of their resources is a guiding principle for multi-tenant organization collaboration. Cross-tenant access settings are required for each tenant-to-tenant relationship. Tenant administrators explicitly configure cross-tenant access partner configurations and identity synchronization settings for partner tenants inside the multi-tenant organization.

To help apply homogenous cross-tenant access settings to partner tenants in the multi-tenant organization, the administrator of each tenant can configure optional cross-tenant access settings templates dedicated to the multi-tenant organization. This article describes how to use templates to preconfigure cross-tenant access settings that are applied to any partner tenant newly joining the multi-tenant organization.

## Autogeneration of cross-tenant access settings

Within a multi-tenant organization, each pair of tenants must have bi-directional [cross-tenant access settings](../external-identities/cross-tenant-access-settings-b2b-collaboration.md), for both, partner configuration and identity synchronization. These settings provide the underlying policy framework for enabling trust and for sharing users and applications.

When your tenant joins a new multi-tenant organization, or when a partner tenant joins your existing multi-tenant organization, cross-tenant access settings to other partner tenants in the enlarged multi-tenant organization, if they don't already exist, are automatically generated in an unconfigured state. In an unconfigured state, these cross-tenant access settings pass through the [default settings](../external-identities/cross-tenant-access-settings-b2b-collaboration.md#configure-default-settings).

Default cross-tenant access settings apply to all external tenants for which you haven't created organization-specific customized settings. Typically, these settings are configured to be nontrusting. For example, cross-tenant trusts for multi-factor authentication and compliant device claims might be disabled and user and group sharing in B2B direct connect or B2B collaboration might be disallowed.

In multi-tenant organizations, on the other hand, cross-tenant access settings are typically expected to be trusting. For example, cross-tenant trusts for multi-factor authentication and compliant device claims might be enabled and user and group sharing in B2B direct connect or B2B collaboration might be allowed.

While the autogeneration of cross-tenant access settings for multi-tenant organization partner tenants in and of itself doesn't change any authentication or authorization policy behavior, it allows your organization to easily customize the cross-tenant access settings for partner tenants in the multi-tenant organization on a per-tenant basis.

## Policy templates at multi-tenant organization formation

As previously described, in multi-tenant organizations, cross-tenant access settings are typically expected to be trusting. For example, cross-tenant trusts for multi-factor authentication and compliant device claims might be enabled and user and group sharing in B2B direct connect or B2B collaboration might be allowed.

While autogeneration of cross-tenant access settings, per previous section, guarantees the existence of cross-tenant access settings for every multi-tenant organization partner tenant, further maintenance of the cross-tenant access settings for multi-tenant organization partner tenants is conducted individually, on a per-tenant basis.

To reduce the workload for administrators at the time of multi-tenant organization formation, you can optionally use policy templates for preemptive configuration of cross-tenant access settings. These template settings are applied at the time of your tenant joins a multi-tenant organization to all external multi-tenant organization partner tenants as well as at the time of any partner tenant joins your existing multi-tenant organization to such new partner tenant.

[Enablement or configuration of the optional policy templates](multi-tenant-organization-configure-templates.md), at the time of a partner tenant joins a multi-tenant organization, preemptively amend the corresponding [cross-tenant access settings](../external-identities/cross-tenant-access-settings-b2b-collaboration.md), for both partner configuration and identity synchronization.

As an example, consider the actions of the administrators for an anticipated multi-tenant organization with three tenants, A, B, and C.

- The administrators of all three tenants enable and configure their respective optional policy templates to enable cross-tenant trusts for multi-factor authentication and compliant device claims and to allow user and group sharing in B2B direct connect and B2B collaboration.
- Administrator A creates the multi-tenant organization and adds tenants B and C as pending tenants to the multi-tenant organization.
- Administrator B joins the multi-tenant organization. Cross-tenant access settings in tenant A for partner tenant B are amended, according to tenant A policy template settings. Vice versa, cross-tenant access settings in tenant B for partner tenant A are amended, according to tenant B policy template settings.
- Administrator C joins the multi-tenant organization. Cross-tenant access settings in tenants A (and B) for partner tenant C are amended, according to tenant A (and B) policy template settings. Similarly, cross-tenant access settings in tenant C for partner tenants A and B are amended, according to tenant C policy template settings.
- Following the formation of this multi-tenant organization of three tenants, the cross-tenant access settings of all tenant pairs in the multi-tenant organization have preemptively been configured.

In summary, configuration of the optional policy templates enable you to homogeneously initialize cross-tenant access settings across your multi-tenant organization, while maintaining maximum flexibility to customize your cross-tenant access settings as needed on a per-tenant basis.

To stop using the policy templates, you can reset them to their default state. For more information, see [Configure multi-tenant organization templates](multi-tenant-organization-configure-templates.md).

## Policy template scoping and additional properties

To provide administrators with further configurability, you can choose when cross-tenant access settings are to be amended according to the policy templates. For example, you can choose to apply the policy templates for the following tenants when a tenant joins a multi-tenant organization:

| Tenant | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Only new partner tenants | Tenants whose cross-tenant access settings are autogenerated |
| Only existing partner tenants | Tenants who already have cross-tenant access settings |
| All partner tenants | Both new partner tenants and existing partner tenants |
| No partner tenants | Policy templates are effectively disabled |

In this context, *new* partners refer to tenants for which you haven't yet configured cross-tenant access settings, while *existing* partners refer to tenants for which you have already configured cross-tenant access settings. This scoping is specified with the `templateApplicationLevel` property on the cross-tenant access [partner configuration template](/graph/api/resources/multitenantorganizationpartnerconfigurationtemplate) and the `templateApplicationLevel` property on the cross-tenant access [identity synchronization template](/graph/api/resources/multitenantorganizationidentitysyncpolicytemplate).

Finally, in terms of interpretation of template property values, any template property value of `null` has no effect on the corresponding property value in the targeted cross-tenant access settings, while a defined template property value causes the corresponding property value in the targeted cross-tenant access settings to be amended in accordance with the template. The following table illustrates how template property values are being applied to corresponding cross-tenant access setting values.

| Template Value | Initial Partner Settings Value<br/>(Before joining multi-tenant org) | Final Partner Settings Value<br/>(After joining multi-tenant org) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `null` | &lt;Partner Settings Value&gt; | &lt;Partner Settings Value&gt; |
| &lt;Template Value&gt; | &lt;any value&gt; | &lt;Template Value&gt; |

## Policy templates used by Microsoft 365 admin center

When a multi-tenant organization is formed in Microsoft 365 admin center, an administrator agrees to the following multi-tenant organization template settings:

- Identity synchronization is set to allow users to synchronize into this tenant
- Cross-tenant access is set to automatically redeem user invitations for both inbound and outbound

This is achieved by setting the corresponding three template property values to `true`:

- `automaticUserConsentSettings.inboundAllowed`
- `automaticUserConsentSettings.outboundAllowed`
- `userSyncInbound`

For more information, see [Join or leave a multi-tenant organization in Microsoft 365](/microsoft-365/enterprise/join-leave-multi-tenant-org).

## Cross-tenant access settings at time of multi-tenant organization disassembly

Currently, there's no equivalent policy template feature supporting the disassembly of a multi-tenant organization. When a partner tenant leaves the multi-tenant organization, each tenant administrator must re-examine and amend accordingly the cross-tenant access settings for the partner tenant that left the multi-tenant organization.

The partner tenant that left the multi-tenant organization must re-examine and amend accordingly the cross-tenant access settings for all former multi-tenant organization partner tenants as well as consider resetting the two policy templates for cross-tenant access settings.
